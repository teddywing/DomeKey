NAME
----
dome-key - Custom mappings for headphone buttons

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dome-key* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enables customisation of headphone buttons. The *dome-key* program runs
in the background listening to button events, executing user-defined
actions in response to these events.

Headphone button mappings are defined in a file called
'~/.config/dome-key/mappings.dkmap'. See 'MAPPINGS' or
dome-key-mappings(7) for more information.

OPTIONS
-------
--audio::
	Play interface audio. Sounds will play to provide feedback when a mode
	is activated or deactivated.

-d, --daemon::
	Run the daemon in the current shell to listen for headphone button
	events. The program will run in the foreground.

-h, --help::
	Print usage help.

--license 'file'::
	Register the software using the license plist file at path 'file'.

-r, --reload-mappings::
	Reload the mappings file. If an instance of *dome-key* is running, no
	updates to the mappings file are taken into account automatically.
	Executing the program with this flag will cause the running daemon to
	reload the mappings file into its memory. This is typically easier
	than killing and relaunching the daemon.

-v, --version::
	Print the program version.
